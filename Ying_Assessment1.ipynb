A KNN regressor is similar to a KNN classifier (covered in Activity 1.1) in that it finds the K nearest neighbors and estimates the value of the given test point based on the values of its neighbours. The main difference between KNN regression and KNN classification is that KNN classifier returns the label that has the majority vote in the neighborhood, whilst KNN regressor returns the average of the neighbors’ values. \n"

Since overfitting happens when the model fits the training set too closely to let randomness and outliers affect the model so that it will perform poorly on testing set. This characteristic can be found in the plot when k ranges from 1 to 12, which shows the training error keeps declining while testing error experience an increase, so it is fair to say from 12 onwards, the model is overfitting. Underfitting happens when the model is simpler than the true model and it fails to capture real trend of data points for both training and testing set. As can be seen in the graph, the MSE of both training set and testing set are declining when 1/k is from 1/20 t0 1/13, this is overfitting as larger k is, the simpler model will be."

In the red box we have 2 apples and 6 oranges, whilst in the blue box we have 3 apples and 1 orange. Now suppose we randomly selected one of the boxes and picked a fruit. If the picked fruit is an apple, what is the probability that it was picked from the blue box?\n",

We are asked to build a model for this dice, i.e. a model which tells what is the probability of each face of the dice if we toss it. Using the maximum likelihood principle, please determine the best value for our model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You can use a multinomial distribution with 6 probability parameters, each of which corresponding to a dice face (as opposed to coin where there are two parameters). You need to form the likelihood objective function, and then maximise it by setting the derivative with respect to the parameters to zero. Since the probabilities must sum up to 1, you only need to maximise the likelihood objective with respect to five parameters; the value of the sixth parameter is then going to be one minus the sum of the other parameters.\n",

    "#### Question 6: \n",
    "As you have seen through the module, you are generally in the position of choosing a less flexible or more flexible model for your regression or classification problem. You need to be aware that we choose a model to serve to our final goal regardless of the flexibility level. It means that we may prefer a less flexible model to a more flexible model, or vice versa. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus a less flexible) approach for regression or classification? Under what circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of flexibale model is that it will fit well on the trainning data and yields a very low training error. As the level of flexibility increases, the model will fit the observed training data more closely. Because the flexible will capture the slight variations in the data, it will result in very low bias. The disadvantage of flexible models is that they tend to cause high variance of test error because changing any\n",
    "one of the data points may cause estimates to change considerably. The flexible model works too hard to find patterns in the training data and\n",
    "may be picking up some patterns that are just caused by random chance\n",
    "rather than by true properties of the unknown true model, which is known as over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "when the true decision boundary is complex and the true model of data has high level of freedom, a flexible method is preferred. If we come from a variance-bias point of view, when the error is dominated by bias rather than variance, a more flexible model will contribute more to the decrease of error. However when variance has more impact on the error than bias, i.e. as the flexibility rise up, the variance will increase rapidly, in this case a more restricted model will outperform the high flexible model.\n",
    "#### Question 7: \n",
    "Describe the differences between a parametric and a non-parametric statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a non- parametric approach)? What are its disadvantages?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "A parametric approach reduces the problem of estimating f down to one of estimating a set of parameters because it assumes a form for f.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-parametric approach does not assume a patricular form of f and so requires a very large sample to accurately estimate f.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification are the simplifying of modeling ff to a few parameters and not as many observations are required compared to a non-parametric approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification are a potentially inaccurate estimate f if the form of f assumed is wrong or to overfit the observations if more flexible models are used."
